# 📊 Data Analyst Internship Projects – Oasis Infobyte

Welcome to my Data Analyst Internship project repository!  
This collection features four end-to-end data analytics projects I completed during my internship at **Oasis Infobyte**, covering topics such as **EDA, customer segmentation, data cleaning,** and **sentiment analysis**. Each task focuses on solving real-world business problems using data and showcases the application of Python, machine learning, and data visualization techniques.

## 📌 Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 🧠 Objective:
To perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis on a structured dataset, discovering key trends, correlations, and patterns using visualizations and descriptive statistics.

### ✅ Key Steps:
- Summary statistics & missing value detection
- Trend analysis using time-series data
- Visualizations using bar charts, histograms, pair plots, and heatmaps

### 🛠️ Tools:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### 📈 Outcome:
Identified actionable insights and data patterns that support data-driven business decisions.

## 📌 Project 2: Customer Segmentation Analysis

### 🧠 Objective:
To segment customers of an e-commerce platform based on behavior and purchase patterns using clustering techniques.

### ✅ Key Steps:
- Feature engineering using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) metrics
- Data scaling and preprocessing
- Applied K-Means Clustering for customer segmentation
- Cluster visualization using 2D and 3D scatter plots

### 🛠️ Tools:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn (KMeans)

### 📈 Outcome:
Created clear customer segments, helping businesses tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer targeting.

## 📌 Project 3: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

### 🧠 Objective:
To ensure data integrity by removing inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers from raw datasets, preparing it for reliable analysis or modeling.

### ✅ Key Steps:
- Detected and removed duplicates
- Handled missing values with mean/median imputation
- Standardized inconsistent formats (e.g., dates, strings)
- Applied IQR method for outlier detection and removal

### 🛠️ Tools:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

### 📈 Outcome:
Delivered a clean, consistent, and ready-to-use dataset suitable for further analysis or machine learning tasks.

## 📌 Project 4: Sentiment Analysis Using NLP

### 🧠 Objective:
To classify public opinion on Twitter as Positive, Negative, or Neutral using natural language processing and machine learning models.

### ✅ Key Steps:
- Cleaned tweet text (removed hashtags, mentions, URLs, etc.)
- Applied TF-IDF Vectorization for feature extraction
- Trained and evaluated:
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes: Accuracy = 71.8%
  - LinearSVC: Accuracy = 86.4%, F1 = 85.6%
- Visualized performance with Confusion Matrix

### 🛠️ Tools:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### 📈 Outcome:
LinearSVC model provided excellent results, making it ideal for real-time opinion monitoring and feedback analysis.
